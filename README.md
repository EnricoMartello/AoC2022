# AoC2022

I tried (with huge delay) the 2022 advent of code, and I am trying to do it using C++. Clearly, at least at the moment, it is very low level but it is a starting point...

I only upload here the working code, and I will try and comment the code as much as possible, as I also have to work for a living.
